<pre><b>[FAQ]  							          </b>
 <i>How long has the project been around offically?   </i>                
    NS started with a simple concept story and storyboards with a couple
  friends in late 2015. After a few months, the project stopped and 
   remained unfinished till picking back up four years later.         

<i>Why did you choose Blockchain to market your product?            </i>
 We wanted to use blockchain technology in our art to allow       
  verifible ownership using the Polygon Network.                    

<i>How often do you release new content?                            </i>
 Hard to tell. Some contributors work for free and don't always   
    have time to work on projects.                                 	

<i>What artist are on the team so far?                              </i>
A few concept artists and storyboard artists. Also a painter.   
    We have writers and editors that helped with the scripFAQ]t.    	
Our music artists range from drummers, producers/editors, 	
and vocalists. Some are still on the team but since the last	
project some have left the team to work on other projects.	

<i>Whats the future of NEUROSHACK as of right now?          	</i>
   Right now we are working on the site, but we plan to release more 
in the next 2 months.
