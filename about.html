<pre>      <b>[FAQ]</b>
							          </b>
	<i>How long has the project been around offically?   </i>                
	NS started with a simple concept story and storyboards with
	a couple friends in late 2015. After a few months, the project
	stopped and remained unfinished till picking back up four 
	years later.         

	<i>Why did you choose Blockchain to market your product?            </i>
	We wanted to use blockchain technology in our art to allow       
	verifible ownership using the Polygon Network.                    

	<i>How often do you release new content?                            </i>
	Hard to tell. Some contributors work for free and don't always   
	have time to work on projects.                                 	

	<i>What artist are on the team so far?                              </i>
	A few concept artists and storyboard artists. Also a painter.   
	We have writers and editors that helped with the script.    	
	Our music artists range from drummers, producers/editors, 	
	and vocalists. Some are still on the team but since the last	
	project some have left the team to work on other projects.	

	<i>Whats the future of NEUROSHACK as of right now?          	</i>
	Right now we are working on the site, but we plan to release
	more in the next 2 months.
